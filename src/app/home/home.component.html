    <p>Wolf Creek Trail hosts approximately 20+ miles of trail, ideal for hiking, mountain biking, trail running, and more. It's also a popular destination for geocachers.

        It’s surrounded by a mixed oak and hickory forest. Occasionally you’ll see wildflowers or some interesting mushrooms after a good rain. This trail is a great place to see fall colors, and can even be a nice place to visit on mild winter days.
